## About Me
I am a reliable and flexible person. I am a quick learner, willing to learn new skills, and very hardworking. My objective is to find an employer where I can use the skills I already have and grow with them. Currently, spend my time reading and writing. Wish to be a good writer like Tolkien and J. K. Rowling. Love running and sleeping. Because I don't have any experience yet, I am looking for an internship if there is one.
